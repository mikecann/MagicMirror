# CONFIGURATION (2.0.0)

## Very simple version but limited (just for checking)
```
{
  module: "MMM-AssistantMk2",
  position: "top_right",
  config: {
    useWelcomeMessage: "brief today"
  }
},
```
This empty configuration will even work if you use;
- using sound programs: `arecord` & `mpg321`
- No Hotword activating (You can activate this with touch or click icon)
- You have `profiles/default.json` and use it for your only one unique account profile.
- All other configuration will be set as default values.

## Full detailed version. (Don't panic. Detailed information will be followed.)
- All configuration fields are set as belows by default.
- If you don't need, just use `ESSENTIALS` parts.
